Along with providing [location services](location.md), the companion app also adds several additional sensors to Home Assistant. If you don't want the `device_tracker` entity but still want sensors to update then just disable the entity in the [entity registry](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/config/#entity-registry) to stop location updates and keep sensor updates.

The sensors provided by the companion app are:

## Activity Sensor
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) `sensor.activity` provides the current motion activity as calculated by iOS along with the confidence of the calculations. Activities known by iOS and given by `sensor.activity` are:
*   `Stationary`
*   `Walking`
*   `Running`
*   `Automotive`
*   `Cycling`

If iOS is unable to calculate an activity from motion data, `Unknown` will be given.

It is possible for multiple activities to be returned, such as `Cycling` and `Stationary` (if you are cycling but at a stop light), the state of the sensor is simply the first of these return by iOS (not necessarily the most likely). A complete list of calculated activities is given by the `types` attribute. See [this post](https://nshipster.com/cmmotionactivity/#traveling-without-moving) by [@Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) over at [nshipster](https://nshipster.com/) for a description of how different scenarios yield multiple activities.

The `confidence` attribute corresponds how accurate iOS believes the report of the current activity is. Possible values are:
*   `Low`
*   `Medium`
*   `High`

![android](/assets/android.svg) This sensor is only available on the full flavor of the Android app that is found in the Google Play Store, it is not available for the minimal flavor. For android the user will have a different set of states to go by:
*   `in_vehicle`
*   `on_bicycle`
*   `on_foot`
*   `running`
*   `still`
*   `tilting`
*   `walking`
*   `unknown`

The attribute for the state will reflect the `confidence` rating from the [Activity Recognition API](https://developers.google.com/location-context/activity-recognition).


## Audio Sensor
![android](/assets/android.svg) This sensor uses [AudioManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioManager?hl=en) so the state will represent the ringer mode on the device, possible values are `normal`, `vibriate` or `silent`. The sensor will update any time the ringer mode on the device has changed. There are also additional attributes that trigger updates as mentioned below:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `audio_mode` | The current audio mode of the device can be either: `normal`, `ringing` (identical to [phone sensor](#phone-state-sensor)), `in_call`, `in_communication` or `unknown` |
| `is_headphones` | Boolean value if headsets or headphones are plugged in, will update if device detects them. |
| `is_mic_muted` | Boolean value if the microphone is currently muted, Android 6.0+ will update as this value changes. |
| `is_music_active` | Boolean value if the device is actively playing music. |
| `is_speakerphone_on` | Boolean value if the device speakerphone is enabled, Android 6.0+ will update as this value changes. |
| `volume_level_*` | The current device volume level for the given volume attributes: `alarm`, `call`, `music`, `ring` |


## Battery Sensors
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) The Battery State sensor (`sensor.battery_state`) provides information on the current status of the devices battery. The three possible values are `Charging`, `Not Charging`, or `Full` when the device is 100 % charged. The Battery Level sensor (`sensor.battery_level`) reports the current battery level of the device from 0â€“100 %. The charge level is reflected in the sensor icon. Additionally there is a "Low Power Mode" attribute that reports `true` or `false` depending on whether your iOS device is in [Low Power Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234) or not.

![android](/assets/android.svg) The Battery State sensor (`sensor.battery_state`) provides information on the current status of the devices battery. The five possible states are `full`, `charging`, `discharging`, `not_charging` or `unknown`. The attribute `is_charging` can be used to determine if the device is currently charging, the attribute `charger_type` can report the type of charger being used. Possible values are `ac`, `usb`, `wireless` and `unknown`. A `battery_health` attribute will show either `good`, `cold`, `dead`, `fail`, `overheated`, `over-voltage` or `unknown`. The sensor icon reflects the charging status, and type of charging being used. The battery state sensor will be updated when the device has a charger connected or disconnected. The battery level sensor will be updated any time any of the other sensors get an update as well as when the device reports low battery and when it has recovered from the low battery alert. Both of these sensors make use of [BatteryManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager?hl=en).


## Bluetooth Sensor
![android](/assets/android.svg) This sensors state will be the total number of connected bluetooth devices. The sensor will update as soon as the bluetooth state of the device changes.

## Connection Type Sensor
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) The following connection types are known by the companion app:
*   `Wi-Fi`
*   `Cellular`
*   `No Connection`

A more specific description of the data connection can be found in the `Cellular Technology` attribute of the sensor (which only appears when on cellular). Possible values for this attribute are:

*   `4G`
*   `3G`
*   `2G`
*   `Cellular`
*   `No Connection`

If the connection type is not recognized, either `Unknown` or `Unknown Technology` will be returned.

![android](/assets/android.svg) Android users will have a `wifi_connection` sensor where the state will reflect the currently connected network name or `<not connected>`. This sensor will update when WiFi is turned on/off and when the device connects to a network. The sensor will also have attributes about the connection itself, see the table above for the different attributes. This sensor makes use of [WifiManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager?hl=en).


## Do Not Disturb Sensor
![android](/assets/android.svg) This sensor will represent the state of Do Not Disturb (DND) on the device. The functionality of DND depends on the version of Android. Possible state values are `off`, `priority_only`, `total_silence`, `alarms_only`, `unavailable` or `unknown`. Not all states will show up on all versions of Android, for example a Pixel 4 XL will only show `off` or `priority_only`. If you never used DND you may see `unavailable` until you change the setting on your device. This sensor will update as soon as the state of DND changes. This sensor uses a [Global](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/provider/Settings.Global?hl=en) variable that is not officially documented but has been available since Android 5.0.


## Geocoded Location Sensor
The [geocoded](https://.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding) location sensor provides a user-friendly description of a users current location coordinates, often containing the name of the place, its address, and other relevant information. This sensor reports many detailed attributes allowing you to create useful [template sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/template/).

Geocoding is handled directly by iOS's [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit) and [Core Location](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/converting_between_coordinates_and_user-friendly_place_names) services. In Android geocoding is handled by the internal [Geocoder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder).
