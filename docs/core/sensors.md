Along with providing [location services](location.md), the companion app also adds several additional sensors to Home Assistant. If you don't want the `device_tracker` entity but still want sensors to update then just disable the entity in the [entity registry](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/config/#entity-registry) to stop location updates and keep sensor updates.

The sensors provided by the companion app depend on which app you're using, see the lists below.

## Multi-Server Support

If multiple servers are connected to the companion app, you can configure whether sensors are sent on a per-server basis. Currently the sensor settings will be common for all connected servers.

![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg) In [Settings](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config/) > Companion App, open the server's settings and change Sensors Sent setting under Privacy. Options available:

- **All** sends all enabled sensors.
- **None** does not send any sensors.

![Android](/assets/android.svg) In [Settings](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config/) > Companion App, go to Manage Sensors and select the sensor you'd like to manage. Tap on the expand/collapse icon at the top of the screen to change settings for a specific server.

## iOS & macOS Sensors

### When Sensors Update

On iOS, sensors update in limited situations: when your location changes, periodically when the app is running in the foreground, when you pull-to-refresh the web view, in the background at a rate determined by iOS, and when performing an "Update Sensors" or via "Send Location" shortcut or push notification. When <a href="/docs/notifications/notification-local">Local Push</a> is enabled and available in ![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg) 2022.6 or later, periodic updates will also be performed.

On macOS, sensors update in the same situations as above as well as immediately when some sensors change.

## Android Sensors

Each ![Android](/assets/android.svg) sensor below can be enabled by navigating to [Settings](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config/) > Companion App > Manage Sensors. By default, most are disabled with the exception of the `battery_level`, `battery_state`, `charger_type` and any that were given permission during onboarding. Once enabled the sensor will begin to send data to your Home Assistant server, if you chose to disable it later on the sensor will stop updating. Upon enabling a sensor the app will request for permissions, if required. If you do not see a sensor listed below then your device does not support it. Some of the sensors below offer custom settings for each of their own needs, read about each one to see what it offers. These settings can be found in the same location where you enable the sensor.

### How Sensors Update

All sensors update during a periodic 15-minute interval and they will also update if other certain conditions are met. Read about each sensor below to understand how often to expect updates. During the 15-minute update interval a low priority foreground notification is temporarily created to prevent the Android system from halting the worker. This notification does not make a sound unless the user has installed a third-party app that intercepts notifications and decides to make a sound. If you are on Android 8.0+ you are free to minimize and/or turn off the notification channel for the `SensorWorker`.

You can change the frequency of sensor updates by navigating to [Settings](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config/) > Companion App > Sensor Update Frequency. You can select between Normal, Fast While Charging or Fast Always. Normal is the default mentioned in the previous paragraph. When set to Fast Always updates will come in every minute. When set to Fast While Charging updates will only come in every minute only while the device is charging, otherwise the default interval will be used. After changing this option you will need to restart the app.

## Active Sensor
![macOS](/assets/macOS.svg) `sensor.active` provides whether the device is currently being used, based on a few different inputs which are provided as attributes to be informative.

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `Idle` | `true` when the machine is not any of the following attributes, but input devices haven't been used in a number of minutes. |
| `Screensaver` | `true` when the screensaver began playing to turn inactive |
| `Locked` | `true` when the device is showing the login screen |

| `Fast User Switched` | `true` when switched to another user |
| `Sleeping` | `true` when the device is sleeping |
| `Terminating` | `true` when the app was quit available. Requires app version 2021.2 or later. |

This sensor has a setting to decide the duration that is considered 'idle'.

## Activity Sensors
![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg) `sensor.activity` provides the current motion activity as calculated by iOS along with the confidence of the calculations. Activities known by iOS and given by `sensor.activity` are:
*   `Stationary`
*   `Walking`
*   `Running`
*   `Automotive`
*   `Cycling`

If iOS is unable to calculate an activity from motion data, `Unknown` will be given.

It is possible for multiple activities to be returned, such as `Cycling` and `Stationary` (if you are cycling but at a stop light), the state of the sensor is simply the first of these return by iOS (not necessarily the most likely). A complete list of calculated activities is given by the `types` attribute. See [this post](https://nshipster.com/cmmotionactivity/#traveling-without-moving) by [@Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) over at [nshipster](https://nshipster.com/) for a description of how different scenarios yield multiple activities.

The `confidence` attribute corresponds how accurate iOS believes the report of the current activity is. Possible values are:
*   `Low`
*   `Medium`
*   `High`

![Android](/assets/android.svg) This sensor is only available on the full flavor of the Android app that is found in the Google Play Store, it is not available for the minimal flavor. For android the user will have a different set of states to go by:
*   `in_vehicle`
*   `on_bicycle`
*   `on_foot`
*   `running`
*   `still`
*   `tilting`
*   `walking`
*   `unknown`

The attribute for the state will reflect the `confidence` rating from the [Activity Recognition API](https://developers.google.com/location-context/activity-recognition). This sensor requires the [Activity Recognition permission](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION).

![Android](/assets/android.svg)
The Sleep Confidence and Sleep Segment sensors utilize the new [Sleep API](https://developers.google.com/location-context/sleep) from Google services. Sleep Segment updates about once a day and Sleep Confidence will update about every 10 minutes. All data is provided by Google.

## Android Auto
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
This sensor is used to determine if the device is connected to Android Auto.  The attributes will return the specific type of connection.

## Android OS Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
Several different sensors around the Android OS build. These sensors make use of [android.os.Build](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build).

| Sensor                      | Description                                                                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `android_os_version`        | Android OS release (e.g. 13).                                                              |
| `android_os_security_patch` | Android OS security patch (e.g. 2023-03-05). Only available as of Android 6 (Marshmallow). |

## App Data Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
These sensors will represent how much data was transmitted and received by the Home Assistant Android app, since the last device reboot. These sensors make use of the [Traffic Stats API](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/net/TrafficStats).


## App Importance Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
This sensor will represent the state of the app to reflect if its in the `foreground` or `service` or any other state it can be. This sensor will update any time any other sensor has an update. See all of the Importance variables in [ActivityManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo) to see what they mean.

Possible states are:

*   `cached`
*   `cant_save_state`
*   `foreground`
*   `foreground_service`
*   `gone`
*   `not_running`
*   `perceptible`
*   `service`
*   `top_sleeping`
*   `visible`


## App Memory Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
This sensor will represent how much memory is being used by the application. The attributes will include how much memory is free and available for the application. This sensor makes use of the [Runtime API](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Runtime).


## App Usage Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
These sensors will represent how the Android system is treating the app based on its usage. There is one binary sensor `app_inactive` which will report whether or not the system currently considers the app to be inactive. The other sensor `app_standby_bucket` will reflect the current standby bucket that the Android system considers for the app. Standby buckets determine how much an app will be restricted from running background tasks such as jobs and alarms. Both of these sensors make use of the [UsageStatsManager API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/UsageStatsManager).

Possible states for `app_standby_bucket` sensor (please refer to the API linked above for their definitions):

*   `active`
*   `frequent`
*   `rare`
*   `restricted`
*   `working_set`
*   `never`


## Audio Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg) <br />
These sensors use the [AudioManager API](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/media/AudioManager?hl=en) to retrieve their state. Look at the table below to find out more about each sensor including how often they update.

| Sensor | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `audio_mode` | The current audio mode of the device can be either: `normal`, `ringing` (identical to [phone sensor](#phone-state-sensor)), `in_call`, `in_communication` or `unknown`. This sensor will update during the normal interval. |
| `is_headphones` | Boolean value if headsets or headphones are plugged in, will update as soon as the device detects the change. |
| `is_mic_muted` | Boolean value if the microphone is currently muted, Android 10+ will update as this value changes. |
| `is_music_active` | Boolean value if the device is actively playing music, this sensor will update during the normal interval. |
| `is_speakerphone_on` | Boolean value if the device speakerphone is enabled, Android 10+ will update as this value changes. |
| `ringer_mode` | The ringer mode on the device, possible values are `normal`, `vibriate` or `silent`. This sensor will update as soon as the ringer mode changes. |
| `volume_level_*` | The current device volume level for the given volume attributes: `accessibility`, `alarm`, `call`, `dtmf`, `music`, `notification`, `ring`, `system`. These sensors will update during the normal interval, or as soon as a change is detected if using the <span class='beta'>BETA</span> version. |


## Battery Sensors
![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg) <br />
The Battery State sensor (`sensor.battery_state`) provides information on the current status of the devices battery. The three possible values are `Charging`, `Not Charging`, or `Full` when the device is 100 % charged. The Battery Level sensor (`sensor.battery_level`) reports the current battery level of the device from 0–100 %. The charge level is reflected in the sensor icon. Additionally there is a "Low Power Mode" attribute that reports `true` or `false` depending on whether your iOS device is in [Low Power Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234) or not.

![Android](/assets/android.svg)<br />
The battery sensors listed below describe the state of the battery for a few different data points. The sensor's icon reflects the charging status, and type of charging being used. The `battery_state`, `charger_type` and `is_charging` sensor will be updated when the device has a charger connected or disconnected. The `battery_health`, `battery_level`, `battery_power` and `battery_temperature` sensors will be updated any time any of the other sensors get an update as well as when the device reports low battery or when it has recovered from the low battery alert. All of these sensors make use of [BatteryManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager).

| Sensor | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `battery_health` | The health of the battery |
| `battery_level` | The percentage of battery remaining |
| `battery_power` | The current wattage on the device |
| `battery_state` | The state of charging on the device |
| `battery_temperature` | The current battery temperature |
| `charger_type` | The type of charger being used on the device |
| `is_charging` | Whether or not the device is actively charging |

:::info
The `battery_power` sensor converts the values returned by the device to amperes and volts. However, some devices do not follow Android documentation and may return values in a different unit, which results in the sensor being incorrect. For these devices you may need to adjust the sensor setting for 'Battery current divisor' to properly convert the `current` to amperes (and when using <span class='beta'>BETA</span>: and for 'Battery voltage divisor' to properly convert the `voltage` to volts).

Common values for the Battery current divisor: 1000000 (default, microamperes), 1000 (milliamperes), 1000000000 (nanoamperes)

Common values for the Battery voltage divisor: 1000 (default, millivolts), 1 (no conversion required, volts)
:::

## Bluetooth Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg)<br />
This Bluetooth Connection state will be the total number of connected bluetooth devices. The sensor will update as soon as the bluetooth state of the device changes. This sensor makes use of Android's [Bluetooth](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/package-summary?hl=en) package.

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `Connected Paired Devices` | The list of paired devices that are currently connected. |
| `Connected Not Paired Devices` | The list of devices that are connected but not paired. |
| `Paired Devices` | The list of devices that are paired. |

There will also be a binary sensor for the `bluetooth_state` that will represent whether or not bluetooth is turned on for the device. This sensor will update anytime the state of bluetooth changes.

![Android](/assets/android.svg)
A BLE Transmitter sensor allows your device to transmit a BLE iBeacon. The iBeacon is capable of being detected by the [iBeacon integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ibeacon) if your device sends the device name ([see why here](https://github.com/home-assistant/android/pull/2941#issuecomment-1272379540)). If your device does not send its device name, it can still be detected if you explicitly allow the UUID via the iBeacon integration options. This sensor can also be useful in conjunction with projects like [roomassistant](https://www.room-assistant.io/) and [esp32-mqtt-room ](https://jptrsn.github.io/ESP32-mqtt-room/) to allow room level tracking.  The current transmitting ID (UUID-Major-Minor) is reported as an attribute that can be copied for use with these systems.

:::caution
This sensor can impact battery life, particularly if used wih Transmit Power set to High. The iBeacon is transmitted every second (low latency to save battery, but sufficient for room presence).
:::

Settings are available to change the UUID, Major and Minor masks. These can be used to change the overall identifier, as well as to allow groups, e.g. family phone devices can have particular Major value which can be whitelisted in apps like roomassistant. These settings are validated: UUID should be the [standard format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), Major and Minor need to be within 0 and 65535.

There are also settings to alter:
*   the Transmit power (between Ultra Low, Low, Medium and High)
*   the Advertise mode (between Low Power (1Hz), Balanced (3Hz) and Low latency (10Hz))
*   the Measured power at 1 meter (must be a negative number)
*   <span class='beta'>BETA</span> whether Transmit is only enabled on Home Wifi Network SSIDs 

A Transmit setting toggle will start or stop the BLE transmissions. This setting as well as most of the above settings can be changed via the [notification command](../notifications/commands.md#ble-beacon-transmitter).

![Android](/assets/android.svg) <br />
The Beacon Monitor shows scans for BLE iBeacons. The state of the sensor shows if the app is monitoring or not. All beacons in range and their distance are listed in the attributes. This sensor will update when there is a new distance measurement available.

Settings are available to change scan period and interval which can be useful to preserve battery life. The setting Filter Iterations and Filter RSSI Multiplier can be adjusted to archive more stable measurements. All of these settings will affect the responsiveness of the sensor. A UUID filter is also available, to limit the reported beacons to those matching (or not matching) a list of UUIDs.

A Monitor setting toggle will start or stop the scans - this setting can also be adjusted via the [notification command](../notifications/commands.md#beacon-monitor).

When the app is actively scanning for beacons a notification will be shown to make background scanning more reliable. If you are on Android 8.0+ you are free to minimize and/or turn off the notification channel for the `Beacon Monitor Scanning`.

## Car Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg)

The sensors listed below describe the state of the car for a few different data points. Currently this is only available for Android Auto. These sensors may not provide data depending on your phone and/or car software. If you see a state of `unknown` check the `status` attribute to see the reason for why it has no data.

:::caution
 Note that you need to start the Home-Assistant app on your Android Auto screen each time that you connect the phone to the car to allow these sensors to work (once started, you can dismiss the app). If the app is not started the state will be `unavailable`.

 To make things easier, you may want to use the [`car_ui` parameter](../android-auto/android-auto.md#notifications) to show a notification on your car when you [connect your phone](./sensors.md#android-auto).
:::

| Sensor | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `car_battery` | The percentage of battery remaining |
| `car_charging_status` | The charging status of the car (only for EVs). The state of the charging port is in the attributes  |
| `car_ev_connector` | List of available EV connectors for the car |
| `car_fuel` | The percentage of fuel remaining |
| `car_fuel_type` | List of available fuel types for the car. |
| `car_name` | The name of the car. The manufacturer name and manufactured year are in the attributes |
| `car_odometer` | The the value of the car odometer in meters |

## Cellular Provider Sensor
The cellular provider sensor displays information about the user’s cellular service provider, such as its unique identifier and whether it allows VoIP calls on its network. `sensor.sim_1` corresponds to the physical SIM card installed and `sensor.sim_2` corresponds to the eSIM (this is only shown if the eSIM is enabled).

![Android](/assets/android.svg) Android users will see these sensors update anytime the network has changed, which makes use of [SubscriptionManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SubscriptionManager?hl=en).

*   `No Connection`

If the connection type is not recognized, either `Unknown` or `Unknown Technology` will be returned.

![Android](/assets/android.svg)<br />
For Android several different types of connection sensors are available and they will update when a network state change has been detected:

| Sensor | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `wifi_connection` | The name of the current connected network |
| `bssid` | The mac address of the current connected network |
| `frequency` | The frequency band of the connected network |
| `wifi_ip_address` | The current IP address of the device on the network |
| `link_speed` | The current link speed of the device to the connected network |
| `signal_strength` | The signal strength of the device to the WiFi network |
| `wifi_state` | Whether or not WiFi is turned on for the device |
| `transport_type` | The transport type for the current network connection. An attribute will reflect if the current network is metered. |
| `hotspot_state` | Whether or not the device is currently broadcasting a WiFi hotspot. (Not available on Wear OS) |
| `ip6_addresses` | <span class='beta'>BETA</span> The ip6_addresses bound to the currently active network|

![Android](/assets/android.svg) The `bssid` sensor offers settings to let you rename the current mac address to help avoid the need for templates and secret usage in automations and the front end. This is generally useful if you have multiple access points and want an easy way to differentiate between them. These settings are turned off by default. These sensors require either [Background Location](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) or [Fine Location](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) permissions, depending on what version of Android you run.

## Current Time Zone Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
This sensor will represent the current time zone the device is in. There are also a few attributes to help describe this time zone. Data is provided by the [TimeZone API](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/TimeZone.html).

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `in_daylight_time` | If the  time zone is currently observing daylight time. |
| `time_zone_id` | The display name of the time zone. |
| `time_zone_short` | The short name of the time zone. |
| `uses_daylight_time` | If the current time zone observes daylight time. |

## Current Version Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)
This sensor will represent the current installed version of the Android app.


## Dynamic Color Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg) Only available on devices with support for Material 3 Dynamic color.

This sensors state will be a hexadecimal color value for the accent color used in the current device theme. [Dynamic color](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/overview) can either be derived from the wallpaper or chosen by the user. An attribute also exists for `rgb_color` in case you wanted to use this color in an automation for the [`light.turn_on`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light/#service-lightturn_on) service call. This sensor uses the [Dynamic Colors API](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/color/DynamicColors).


## Do Not Disturb Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg) 6+ only<br />
This sensor will represent the state of Do Not Disturb (DND) on the device. The functionality of DND depends on the version of Android. Possible state values are `off`, `priority_only`, `total_silence`, `alarms_only`, `unavailable` or `unknown`. Not all states will show up on all versions of Android, for example a Pixel 4 XL will only show `off` or `priority_only`. If you never used DND you may see `unavailable` until you change the setting on your device. This sensor will update as soon as the state of DND changes. This sensor uses the [NotificationManager API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationManager#getCurrentInterruptionFilter()) which is only available on Android 6+ devices.


## Doze Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)<br />
This sensor is only available on devices running Android 6.0+. The state will reflect whether or not the device is in doze mode. The state will update immediately upon a state change and data is provided by [PowerManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html). There is one attribute `ignoring_battery_optimizations` which will show `true` or `false` if the Companion app is ignoring battery optimizations. If you are curious about how the state actually changes you may test it by following these [outlined steps](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#testing_doze).


## Frontmost App Sensor
![macOS](/assets/macOS.svg)<br />
This sensor updates immediately when the frontmost app changes.

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `Bundle Identifier` | The bundle identifier of the app. For example, `io.home-assistant.example`. |
| `Is Hidden` | Whether the application is hidden. |
| `Launch Date` | The date (in ISO 8601, RFC 3339 format) the app was launched. For example, `2021-01-06T22:17:30-08:00`. |
| `Owns Menu Bar` | Whether the application "owns" the menu bar. For example, a menu-bar-only app will not change the contents of the menu bar, even when it is frontmost it is not necessarily as primary. |

## Geocoded Location Sensor
The [geocoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding) location sensor provides a user-friendly description of a users current location coordinates, often containing the name of the place, its address, and other relevant information. This sensor reports many detailed attributes allowing you to create useful [template sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/template/).

Geocoding is handled directly by iOS's [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit) and [Core Location](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/converting_between_coordinates_and_user-friendly_place_names) services. In Android geocoding is handled by the internal [Geocoder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder).

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `Location` | The latitude and longitude coordinates of the placemark. |
| `Name` | The name of the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg)only and ![Android](/assets/android.svg) |
| `Country` | The name of the country associated with the placemark. |
| `ISOCountryCode` | The abbreviated country name. |
| `TimeZone` | The time zone associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg)only |
| `AdministrativeArea` | The state or province associated with the placemark. |
| `SubAdministrativeArea` | Additional administrative area information for the placemark. |
| `PostalCode` | The postal code associated with the placemark. |
| `Locality` | The city associated with the placemark. |
| `SubLocality` | Additional city-level information for the placemark. |
| `Thoroughfare` | The street address associated with the placemark. |
| `SubThoroughfare` | Additional street-level information for the placemark. |
| `AreasOfInterest` | The relevant areas of interest associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg)only |
| `Ocean` | The name of the ocean associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg)only |
| `InlandWater` | The name of the inland water body associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg)only |
| `phone` | The phone number for the placemark, if available. ![Android](/assets/android.svg) |
| `premises` | The premises for the placemark, if available. ![Android](/assets/android.svg) |
| `url` | The URL for the placemark, if available. ![Android](/assets/android.svg) |

![Android](/assets/android.svg) Android users will have a sensor setting for the minimum required accuracy, that defaults to 200m. Users may adjust this to fit their own needs if they find inaccurate reports or not enough reports. This sensor requires either [Background Location](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) or [Fine Location](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) permissions, depending on what version of Android you run. All attributes will be lowercase and all spaces are replaced with an underscore. The sensor will only send an update if it is accurate and recent. The sensor will also update with location updates if location tracking is enabled. A setting also exists to keep the sensor up to date with location updates, by default this is turned off.

![iOS](/assets/iOS.svg) and ![macOS](/assets/macOS.svg) users will have a sensor setting for whether to use the name of an active Zone if present instead of the geocoded state, defaulting to not using it.

## High Accuracy Mode
![Android](/assets/android.svg) This sensors state will reflect if the device has [high accuracy mode](location.md#high-accuracy-mode) currently enabled or not. This sensor will update as soon as the state of high accuracy mode changes, the sensor will not appear until high accuracy mode is enabled for the first time.

## High Accuracy Update Interval
![Android](/assets/android.svg) This sensors state will reflect the update interval for the device in seconds for [high accuracy mode](location.md#high-accuracy-mode). This sensor will update as soon as the value changes either manually or by the [notification command](../notifications/commands.md#high-accuracy-mode).

## Interactive Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg) This sensors state will reflect if the device is in an interactive state. This is typically when the screen comes on and off but may vary from device to device. This sensor will update as soon state changes are detected, data is provided by [PowerManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html).

Using the [History Stats Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/history_stats/), it is possible to monitor both the daily screen time `type: time` as well as the amount of times the screen has been turned on that day `type: count`.

## Keyguard Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg)

These sensors will reflect various states from the [Keyguard Manager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager). You will be able to determine if the device is actively locked, has a password setup or even if the device requires a password to unlock. These sensors will update with the periodic sensor interval.

## NFC State Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)

 This sensors state will reflect if the device has its NFC sensor currently enabled or not. This sensor will update as soon state changes are detected. Data is provided by [NfcAdapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/NfcAdapter).

## Notification Sensors
![Android](/assets/android.svg)<br />

Note: Sensors with Allow Lists will not appear as new entities in Home Assistant until one of the allowed apps receives a new notification.

### Last Notification

This sensor will reflect the last notification posted on the device. This sensor requires a special permission that the app will take the user to so they can grant access to notifications. This sensors state will default to the text of the notification or if not available the posting package name. This sensor offers a setting for an Allow List to let the user select which packages they wish to get notification data from, notifications sent by Home Assistant are always ignored. You need to either create an allow list or enable the setting to "Disable Allow List Requirement". Keep in mind without an allow list this sensor has the potential to drain a lot of battery. We highly recommend creating an allow list over disabling this requirement. This can be very useful to integrate any app that sends a notification but does not offer direct integration (ex: food delivery apps or 2FA SMS codes). There are several attributes a user can expect to see, although not all attributes will contain data. This sensor makes use of the [NotificationListenerService API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService#onNotificationRemoved(android.service.notification.StatusBarNotification)).  More details on each attribute can be found in the [Notification Extras](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification).

### Last Removed Notification

This sensor is similar to Last Notification except that it will update when a notification has been removed from the device, either by the user or an application. You can expect to see similar attributes for this sensor, some of which are outlined below. This sensor requires the same permission as mentioned up above. This sensor also has an allow list that functions similar to Last Notification.

### Active Notification Count

This sensor will reflect the total active notifications on the device. This count will include notifications that are persistent and/or silent. At times it may even include the Sensor Worker notification. This sensor will update whenever any of the other sensors have an update. This sensor requires the same permissions as mentioned in Last Notification. There is no allow list for this sensor.<br /><br />


Below you can find some details that can be given with some notifications.


| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `android.appInfo` | App Info that contains the package name. |
| `android.infoText` | Text that is informative to the notification. |
| `android.largeIcon` | The large icon of the notification. |
| `android.progress` | The progress of the notification, if it has a progress bar. |
| `android.progressIndeterminate` | Whether or not the progress can be determined. |
| `android.progressMax` | The max position of the progress (ex: 100 for 100%). |
| `android.reduced.images` | If images on the notification were reduced. |
| `android.remoteInputHistory` | The most recent input for the notification. |
| `android.showChronometer` | If the chronometer is shown. |
| `android.showWhen` | If the notification should be shown at a specific time. |
| `android.subText` | The subtitle of the notification. |
| `android.text` | The text of the notification. |
| `android.title` | The title of the notification. |
| `is_clearable` | If the notification can be cleared. |
| `is_ongoing` | If the notification is persistent on the device. |
| `package` | The package that posted the notification. |
| `post_time` | The time the notification was posted on the device. |
| `channel_id` | The ID of the channel the notification posted to. This attribute is only available on Android 8+. |
| `group_id` | The ID of the group the notification posted to. |
| `category` | The category that the notification defined. |


### Media Session Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)<br />
This sensor requires notification permissions in order to be enabled and send data. The state will be the playback state of the primary media session. If no media sessions are active then the state will be `unavailable`. Attributes will include a total count of active sessions and media data from all active sessions separated by package name. This sensor will update during the normal sensor update interval. To get the most out of this sensor we recommend using [Last Notification](#last-notification) to hook into your media apps to send faster updates. This sensor uses the [MediaController](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/session/MediaController) and [MediaSessionManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/session/MediaSessionManager) APIs to get the data.


## Last Reboot Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)<br />
This sensors state will be the date and time of the last reboot from the device in UTC format. The sensor will update during the normal sensor update interval. The state will be `unavailable` if the timestamp cannot be determined. This sensor uses the [SystemClock](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/SystemClock?hl=en) and current [System](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/System?hl=en) time to calculate the timestamp. This sensor offers a deadband setting, that defaults to 1 minute, to account for time calculation issues seen over certain carriers.

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `Local Time` | The date and time of the last reboot in local time. |
| `Time in Milliseconds` | The time date and time of the last reboot in milliseconds. |


## Last Update Trigger Sensor
![Android](/assets/android.svg)

For android this sensors state will reflect the [intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) of the most recent update sent. Additionally the sensor offers settings to allow the user to receive [app events](../integrations/app-events.md) from other Android apps that broadcast an intent. Users can register for as many intents as they like, an event will be sent to Home Assistant once the intent has been received. Once you save an intent be sure to restart the application to register for the intent.

If you notice an intent you registered for in settings is no longer being triggered by the app then you will need to add categories that the intent is expecting. You can add categories after the intent by editing the setting for the intent and adding a `,` followed by the category. If more than 1 category is required then you will need to add each category followed by a `,` until there are no more categories to add. For example if your intent requires 2 categories the format will be: `intent,category1,category2`. After saving the intent and category make sure to restart the application.
