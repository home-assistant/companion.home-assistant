Along with providing [location services](location.md), the companion app also adds several additional sensors to Home Assistant. **It is important to know that these sensors are only updated when a location is pushed to Home Assistant or the web view is refreshed**. If you don't want the `device_tracker` entity but still want sensors to update then just disable the entity in the [entity registry](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/config/#entity-registry) to stop location updates and keep sensor updates.

The sensors provided by the companion app are:

![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) iOS Sensor List

| Sensor | Attributes | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `sensor.activity` | `confidence`, `types` | The current activity type as computed by iOS. Requires motion permissions to be enabled. |
| `sensor.average_active_pace` | None | The averaged pace calculated by iOS from pedometer data. Units: meters per second, m/s |
| `sensor.battery_level` | `Battery State` | The current battery level of the device. Current battery state is available from the `Battery State` attribute of this sensor. |

Attributes such as `Cellular Technology` can be accessed with a template such as:

```
{{ states.sensor.connection_type.attributes['Cellular Technology'] }}
```

![android](/assets/android.svg) Android Sensor List

| Sensor | Attributes | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `sensor.battery_level` | `is_charging`, `charger_type` | The state of the sensor reflects the devices battery level. `is_charging` attribute will be either `true` or `false`. `charger_type` will show either `N/A`, `AC`, `USB` or `Wireless`. |
| `sensor.geocoded_location` | [See Below](#geocoded-location-sensor) | Calculated address based on GPS data. |
| `sensor.wifi_connection` | `bssid`, `ip_address`, `link_speed`, `is_hidden`, `frequency`, `signal_level` | The state of the sensor will show the name of the connected network or `<not connected>`. |

## Activity Sensor
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) `sensor.activity` provides the current motion activity as calculated by iOS along with the confidence of the calculations. Activities known by iOS and given by `sensor.activity` are:
*   `Stationary`
*   `Walking`
*   `Running`
*   `Automotive`
*   `Cycling`

If iOS is unable to calculate an activity from motion data, `Unknown` will be given.

It is possible for multiple activities to be returned, such as `Cycling` and `Stationary` (if you are cycling but at a stop light), the state of the sensor is simply the first of these return by iOS (not necessarily the most likely). A complete list of calculated activities is given by the `types` attribute. See [this post](https://nshipster.com/cmmotionactivity/#traveling-without-moving) by [@Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) over at [nshipster](https://nshipster.com/) for a description of how different scenarios yield multiple activities.

The `confidence` attribute corresponds how accurate iOS believes the report of the current activity is. Possible values are:
*   `Low`
*   `Medium`
*   `High`

## Battery Sensors
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) The Battery State sensor (`sensor.battery_state`) provides information on the current status of the devices battery. The three possible values are `Charging`, `Not Charging`, or `Full` when the device is 100% charged.

![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) ![android](/assets/android.svg) The Battery Level sensor (`sensor.battery_level`) reports the current battery level of the device from 0-100%. The charge level is reflected in the sensor icon.  For Android users the sensor has attributes to help distinguish if the device is actively charging and how it is charging, see the table above for the attributes and their values.

## Connection Type Sensor
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) The following connection types are known by the companion app:
*   `Wi-Fi`
*   `Cellular`
*   `No Connection`

A more specific description of the data connection can be found in the `Cellular Technology` attribute of the sensor (which only appears when on cellular). Possible values for this attribute are:

*   `4G`
*   `3G`
*   `2G`
*   `Cellular`
*   `No Connection`

If the connection type is not recognized, either `Unknown` or `Unknown Technology` will be returned.

![android](/assets/android.svg) Android users will have a `wifi_connection` sensor where the state will reflect the currently connected network name or `<not connected>`. The sensor will also have attributes about the connection itself, see the table above for the different attributes.

## Last Update Trigger Sensor
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) This sensor displays exactly what caused the last update of location and sensor data from the device to Home Assistant.

| State | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| Manual | A manual update is triggered when the user pulls to refresh. |
| Initial | Sensors are updated upon initial app launch. |
| Significant Location Update | Triggers when there has been a significant change in the deviceâ€™s location, such as 500 meters or more. See [location](location.md) for additional details. |
| Geographic Region Entered | Triggered when entering any user-specified Home Assistant [zone](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/zone/) (also known as geofencing). |
| Geographic Region Exited | Triggered when exiting any user-specified Home Assistant [zone](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/zone/) (also known as geofencing). |
| Push Notification | [Requesting location updates](../notifications/location.md) via push notification.  |
| Background Fetch | When the app refreshes sensor information in the background. |
| Siri | Location updates triggered via the [Siri Shortcuts](../integrations/siri-shortcuts.md) "Send Location" shortcut. |
| iBeacon Region Entered | Triggered when an iBeacon is seen that corresponds to a known zone. |


## Geocoded Location Sensor
The [geocoded](https://.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding) location sensor provides a user-friendly description of a users current location coordinates, often containing the name of the place, its address, and other relevant information. This sensor reports many detailed attributes allowing you to create useful [template sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/template/).

Geocoding is handled directly by iOS's [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit) and [Core Location](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/converting_between_coordinates_and_user-friendly_place_names) services. In Android geocoding is handled by the internal [Geocoder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder).

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `Location` | The latitude and longitude coordinates of the placemark. |
| `Name` | The name of the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) iOS only, for Android check the state of the sensor. |
| `Country` | The name of the country associated with the placemark. |
| `ISOCountryCode` | The abbreviated country name. |
| `TimeZone` | The time zone associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) iOS only |
| `AdministrativeArea` | The state or province associated with the placemark. |
| `SubAdministrativeArea` | Additional administrative area information for the placemark. |
| `PostalCode` | The postal code associated with the placemark. |
| `Locality` | The city associated with the placemark. |
| `SubLocality` | Additional city-level information for the placemark. |
| `Thoroughfare` | The street address associated with the placemark. |
| `SubThoroughfare` | Additional street-level information for the placemark. |
| `AreasOfInterest` | The relevant areas of interest associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) iOS only |
| `Ocean` | The name of the ocean associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) iOS only |
| `InlandWater` | The name of the inland water body associated with the placemark. ![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) iOS only |

## Pedometer Sensors
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) The pedometer sensors provide step-counting data from the devices built-in motion processor. They keep a tally of your daily on-foot activity, and reset at midnight. These sensors require motion permissions to be enabled.

| `sensor.floors_descended` | The approximate number of floors descended by walking. |


## Cellular Provider Sensor
![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) The cellular provider sensor displays information about the userâ€™s cellular service provider, such as its unique identifier and whether it allows VoIP calls on its network. `sensor.sim_1` corresponds to the physical SIM card installed and `sensor.sim_2` corresponds to the eSIM (this is only shown if the eSIM is enabled).

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `Carrier Name` | The name of the userâ€™s home cellular service provider. |
| `Current Radio Technology` |  |
