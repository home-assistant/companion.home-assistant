The Home Assistant Companion App provides a convenient way to view and control your Home Assistant instance however it also extends the power of your instance by allowing your device to act as a data source. The Home Assistant Companion App adds numerous [sensors](sensors.md) (such as battery and network status among others), creates a `device_tracker` entity to allow [location](location.md) updates to be sent from the device and also provides [action shortcuts](actions.md) to trigger scripts or automations.

Not all features are supported by Android at the moment but eventually most features will be supported.  Look for the ![android](assets/android.svg) Android logo to see what is currently supported.
