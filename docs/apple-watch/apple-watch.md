Home Assistant has deep integration with the Apple Watch. You can display Home Assistant information as complications directly on your watch face and since app version 2024.9, run scripts, active scenes, and iOS Actions.

## Home

Since iOS App version 2024.9 release, you can now customize your Home Assistant watch experience using `Scripts`, `Scenes`, and `iOS Actions`.
Using your iPhone, open the Companion app settings and under the **Apple Watch** section, look for **Configuration**. If you already had **iOS Actions** created, they will be migrated into the configuration screen. Select **Save** and reload on your watch.

## Complication types

The Apple Watch has a variety of Faces and Complications. It's useful to consult the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/system-experiences/complications/) for an example of the different Families and how the particular Complications will display. There are 4 main types of information you can put into Complications:

- Text, which can render as a [template](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/), is displayed at various font weights and sizes depending on the template type.
- Ring and Gauge, which appear circular lines. An open variant appears as a complete circle and a closed variant has concrete start and end locations in the icon. Rings and Gauges require numeric values between `0.0` (empty) and `1.0` (full) and also support [templates](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/).
- Images can be selected from the [Material Design Icons](http://materialdesignicons.com) choices supported by the app. 

:::info Supported Complication types
As of watchOS 9, several (legacy) Complication types are no longer supported by Apple. The following Complication types can be used for watchOS 9 and higher: Graphic Circular, Graphic Corner, Graphic Rectangular & Modular Large. Further details on the different types can be found in the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components/system-experiences/complications/).
