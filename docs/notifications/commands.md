The Companion apps offer a lot of different notification options. In place of posting an actual notification on the device you can instead send a command as the `message` to trigger certain actions on your phone. Read below to find out what commands are supported on each platform.

## Do Not Disturb

![Android](/assets/android.svg) Android 6+ only

On Android you can send `message: command_dnd` that you can use to control the state of Do Not Disturb on the device. This command requires a specific permission that the app is unable to prompt or auto-accept. Instead by sending the command for the first time the app will launch an activity allowing the user to enable Home Assistant access to the devices Notification Policy. This is required in order for the app to gain control of this setting.

In addition to sending the `message` you must also provide the state of Do Not Disturb that you wish to set as the `title`, see the table below for what is accepted. If the `title` does not match one of the listed commands then the notification will post as normal and the command will not process. This command is only available for users on Android 6+, users on lower versions will see the notification just like any other.

| `title` | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `alarms_only` | Alarms only interruption filter - all notifications except those in the alarm category are suppressed. Some audio streams are muted. |
| `off` | Normal interruption filter - no notifications are suppressed. |
| `priority_only` | Priority interruption filter - all notifications are suppressed except those that match the priority criteria. Some audio streams are muted. |
| `total_silence` | No interruptions filter - all notifications are suppressed and all audio streams (except those used for phone calls) and vibrations are muted. |
| Anything else | The notification will post as a normal notification and the command will not process. |
