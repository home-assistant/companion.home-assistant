Notifications may contain an image, video, or audio file attachment that is displayed alongside the notification. A thumbnail is shown on the notification preview and the full size attachment is displayed after the notification is expanded.

An attachment is an image, video, or audio file which is downloaded to the device when a notification is received and shown alongside the notification. A thumbnail is shown when the notification is not expanded. The full size attachment is shown when the notification is expanded.

> To expand a notification on 3D Touch devices simply force touch any notification. On non-3D Touch devices swipe and tap the "View" button.
