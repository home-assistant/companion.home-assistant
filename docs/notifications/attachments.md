Notifications may contain an image, video, or audio file attachment that is displayed alongside the notification. A thumbnail is shown on the notification preview and the full size attachment is displayed after the notification is expanded.

An attachment is an image, video, or audio file which is downloaded to the device when a notification is received and shown alongside the notification. A thumbnail is shown when the notification is not expanded. The full size attachment is shown when the notification is expanded.

It is important to note that the attachments are required to be accessible from the internet. If you plan to use [`camera.snapshot`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/camera#service-snapshot), you will want to store the image in the `www` folder located in your Home Assistant [config directory](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/). This will then expose the image to the internet so that you may use it in your notifications and receive them anywhere. The proper format for the URL is: `https://MyCustomHADomain/local/path/to/file.jpg`. Make sure to replace `MyCustomHADomain` with how you would access Home Assistant remotely in a browse, you will either use your [Nabu Casa remote URL](https://www.nabucasa.com/config/remote/) or the [base URL](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http#base_url). Also, replace `path/to/file.jpg` with the actual file name and location you used in your [`camera.snapshot`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/camera#service-snapshot) service call. Another acceptable format for the above is `/local/path/to/file.jpg`.
![](/assets/android.svg) Android users can also use `/api/camera_proxy/camera.name` where `camera.name` is replaced by the entity ID of the camera you wish to use.
![](/assets/apple.svg) iOS users can use the [camera stream in dynamic attachments](dynamic-content.md#camera-stream).

:::tip
