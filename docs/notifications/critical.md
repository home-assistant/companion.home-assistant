Critical notifications were introduced in iOS 12 and are designed for sending high-priority notifications that you don't want to miss - for example security system, water leak sensor, and smoke/CO2 alarm alerts.

iOS gives special priority to this type of notification. Critical alerts always appear at the top of your lock screen above all other notifications, and play a sound even if Do Not Disturb is enabled or the iPhone is muted. Because we never want you to miss a critical notification, they are allowed to bypass the app [notification rate limits](details.md) as well.

For Android these notifications are designed to show up on the phone immediately. By default they do not override Do Not Disturb settings, if you would like to override this you will need to use [notification channels](basic.md#notification-channels). They also do not make the notification sound when the phone is muted.

A simple example of sending a critical notification is:

![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) iOS example

```yaml
automations:
  - alias: 'Fire Detected'
    trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
      to: 'smoke'
    action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
      data:
        title: "Wake up!"
        message: "The house is on fire and the cat's stuck in the dryer!"
        data:
          push:
            sound:
              name: default
              critical: 1
              volume: 1.0

```

![android](/assets/android.svg) Android example for high priority notification

```yaml
automations:
  - alias: 'Fire Detected'
    trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
      to: 'smoke'
    action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
      data:
        title: "Wake up!"
        message: "The house is on fire and the cat's stuck in the dryer!"
        data:
          ttl: 0
          priority: high
```

If you have previously read the [sounds documentation](sounds.md) this syntax should be mostly familiar. Note the example expands the `sound` attribute to include the `critical: 1` flag, and `volume: 1.0` to set the volume to 100Â %.

![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) For **CarPlay** users, it's also worth mentioning that critical notifications are the only ones that can appear on the car's built-in display, making them very useful if you want to know when something critical happens while you're driving.
