title: "Requesting location updates"

> Do not rely on this functionality due to the time limitations mentioned below.

You can force a device to attempt to report its location by sending a special notification. The notification is not visible to the device owner and only works when the app is running or in the background. On success the sensor.last_update_trigger will change to "Push Notification".

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Notify Mobile app
    trigger:
      ...
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
      data:
        message: "request_location_update"
```

Assuming the device receives the notification, it will attempt to get a location update within 5 seconds and report it to Home Assistant. This is a little bit hit or miss since Apple imposes a maximum time allowed for the app to work with the notification and location updates sometimes take longer than usual due to factors such as waiting for GPS acquisition.
