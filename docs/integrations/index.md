The Home Assistant Companion App provides deep integration within iOS and Android. Key features include the use of [haptics](haptics.md) to provide feedback within the app. The app itself can use themes defined within Home Assistant. The app can trigger actions or events via the [URL handler](url-handler.md).  Look for the <img class='OSlogo' src='/assets/android.svg' alt='Android logo' /> Android logo to see what is currently supported in the Android app.
