Home Assistant Companion features haptics, which provide physical feedback when interacting with the UI. Areas you will feel haptic feedback include toggles (lights, switches, input_booleans) and input_selects. Certain scenarios such as invalid service call errors will also generate haptic feedback.

Android devices that have haptic feedback support and/or a vibration motor can expect to feel some type of feedback.

## Disabling Haptics
Home Assistant Companion respects the OS-level setting for disabling haptics. In iOS Settings, navigate to "Sounds & Haptics" and then toggle off "System Haptics" at the bottom of the screen. See the [Apple Support document](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-the-sounds-and-vibrations-iph07c867f28/ios) for more information. On Android you can disable Vibration from the Home Assistant user profile page to disable this feature.

## Developers: Integrating Haptics into Custom Cards
WIP: Instructions on integrating haptics supports into custom cards will go here. You can fire an event when your custom card is interacted with that the iOS app will listen for and re-interpret into haptic feedback.

Home Assistant Companion supports all seven haptic strength levels as defined by [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/feedback/). Android will try to make a best effort to match these with existing [Haptic Feedback Constants](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/HapticFeedbackConstants#constants_1) and/or [Vibration Effects](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/VibrationEffect.html#constants_1).

| Haptic | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `success` | Indicates that a task or action has completed. |
| `warning` | Indicates that a task or action has produced a warning of some kind. |
| `failure` | Indicates that a task or action has failed. |
| `light` | Provides a physical metaphor that complements the visual experience. |
| `medium` | Provides a physical metaphor that complements the visual experience. |
| `heavy` | Provides a physical metaphor that complements the visual experience. |
| `selection` | Indicates that the selection is actively changing. |
