The ![Android](/assets/android.svg) Android app has the ability to intercept certain types of links to allow the user to directly launch another app found on the device (or take the user to install the app if not found). Users can also use the [Intent Scheme](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/multidevice/android/intents/#syntax) to perform any action that is supported by the app.

Examples using Lovelace entity card [weblink](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/entities/#weblink):

This example will launch Twitter if it is installed on the device, otherwise it will open the Google Play store app or website.
```yaml
- type: weblink
  name: Twitter
  url: "app://com.twitter.android"
```

This example will launch the barcode scanning app ready to scan via the Intent scheme, if the app is not installed the user will be directed to installing it.
```yaml
- type: weblink
  name: Scan
  url: "intent://scan/#Intent;scheme=zxing;package=com.google.zxing.client.android;end"
```
