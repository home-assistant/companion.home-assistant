## NFC Tags & QR Codes

A Home Assistant NFC tag or QR code contains a URL in the following format:

`https://www.home-assistant.io/tag/<tag id>`

- ![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) On iOS, bringing your device near an NFC tag or scanning a QR code will show a notification which, when tapped, will launch the app and fire an event.
- ![android](/assets/android.svg) On Android, bringing your device near a Home Assistant NFC tag or scanning a QR code will fire an event.

The event which fires is the same on both iOS and Android: `tag_scanned`. Example Automation:

```yaml
# for https://www.home-assistant.io/tag/50A3C7C8-1FE7-4BE8-8DC9-06E07D41B63D
automation:
- alias: Unlock the Door
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: tag_scanned
    event_data:
      tag_id: 50A3C7C8-1FE7-4BE8-8DC9-06E07D41B63D
  action:
    # ...
```

Both apps support reading and writing NFC tags. You can use a randomly-generated tag value (like the above) or a custom one.

:::info
Some NFC tags are read-only and cannot be used as a Home Assistant NFC tag. Others may only allow one write before they turn read-only.

## ![iOS](/assets/apple.svg) Old-Style Universal Links

Universal links are a alternative to the [URL Handler](integrations/url-handler.md) and [X-Callback-URL](integrations/x-callback-url.md).

The app has registered all URLs under `https://www.home-assistant.io/ios/` as valid Universal Links. However, at this time, there is only one Universal Link that the app understands:

`https://www.home-assistant.io/ios/nfc/?url=<a URL you could use with the existing URL handler>`

What this allows for is NFC support. You can write a NFC tag with a NDEF URL like the above and whenever your device sees that NFC tag, a notification will appear for you to open the app with.

Once you open the app, it will do whatever action you told it to in the URL.
