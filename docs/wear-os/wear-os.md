Home Assistant has started to offer a beta version of the Wear OS app in the Google Play Store. Support at this moment is very minimal. You must be a beta user of the phone app to participate in the beta for the watch app. The following list of domains are currently supported to toggle/execute once you login and select them:

* `input_boolean`
* `light`
* `scene`
* `script`
* `switch`

# Tiles

The shortcuts tile shows up to 7 shortcuts, which can be chosen from the settings section in the Wear OS app.

# Beta

You can sign up for the beta [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.homeassistant.companion.android). Once installed you will be directed to adding your server and logging in.

Keep an eye out on this page as the application is enhanced with new features!
