Home Assistant has started to offer a beta version of the Wear OS app in the Google Play Store. Support at this moment is very minimal. You must be a beta user of the phone app to participate in the beta for the watch app. As of now you will get a list of `light`, `scene` and `script` entities to toggle/execute once you login to the app.

You can sign up for the beta [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.homeassistant.companion.android). Once installed you will be directed to adding your server and logging in.

Keep an eye out on this page as the application is enhanced with new features!
