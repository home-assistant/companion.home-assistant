The Wear OS app also offers [sensors](../core/sensors.md#android-sensors) to consume your wearable data in Home Assistant, please refer to the link to learn more about how sensors update on Android. Not all sensors offered by the phone app will be offered by the Wear OS app. Please see the list below for what sensors are currently supported by the Wear OS app. If a sensor requires permissions you will be prompted to accept, otherwise the sensor will not enable and send data.

It's important to note that sensor updates require the app to post a notification to the device in order to prevent it from being killed by the OS. You can go to into Wear device settings and turn off the SensorWorker Notification channel to stop these notifications from buzzing on your wrist.

:::info
Sensor updates are dependent upon the watch having data connectivity and the app being allowed to send an update. Some devices implement stricter battery saving techniques than others so updates may not happen as frequently as you would expect.

There is currently no support for sensor settings. Some sensors may not be fully operational as a result. For example, the BLE Transmitter and Beacon Monitor sensors can only be enabled, none of the settings can be changed as of this moment. These sensors may not be completely functional while we work on adding sensor settings, the default settings will allow for primary functionality.
