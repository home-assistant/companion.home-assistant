The app features many of the sensors offered by the main version as the Quest runs Android. Check out the Manage Sensors screen in settings to see what sensors are currently supported. To learn about each Android sensor and how sensors work in general make sure to check the [sensors](/core/sensors.md#android-sensors) documentation. If you are looking for a sensor to determine if you are currently using the headset then consider enabling the [interactive sensor](/core/sensors.md#interactive-sensor).


Not all features of the Android app will work on the Oculus Quest as it runs a heavily modified fork of Android. There are no google services, no widgets, no shortcuts and no standard notifications.

On this page we will be covering specific features and sensors built for the Oculus Quest as they are ready, stay tuned for more updates!
