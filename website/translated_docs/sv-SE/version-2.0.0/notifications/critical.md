Critical notifications were introduced in iOS 12 and are designed for sending high-priority notifications that you don't want to miss - for example security system, water leak sensor, and smoke/CO2 alarm alerts.

iOS gives special priority to this type of notification. Critical alerts always appear at the top of your lock screen above all other notifications, and play a sound even if Do Not Disturb is enabled or the iPhone is muted. Because we never want you to miss a critical notification, they are allowed to bypass the app [notification rate limits](details.md) as well.

A simple example of sending a critical notification is:

```yaml
automations:
  - alias: 'Fire Detected'
    trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
      to: 'smoke'
    action:
    - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
      data:
        title: "Wake up!"
        message: "The house is on fire and the cat's stuck in the dryer!"
        data:
          push:
            sound:
              name: default
              critical: 1
              volume: 1.0

```

If you have previously read the [sounds documentation](sounds.md) this syntax should be mostly familiar. Note the example expands the `sound` attribute to include the `critical: 1` flag, and `volume: 1.0` to set the volume to 100Â %.
