The app attempts to match the theme that the frontend is currently using. Theme keys that the app will use are:

- `primary-background-color` for the background color of the web view
- `primary-color` for the status bar background color
- `text-primary-color` for the pull to refresh tint color

Themes should update in real time. Only system themes, not user themes, are supported.
