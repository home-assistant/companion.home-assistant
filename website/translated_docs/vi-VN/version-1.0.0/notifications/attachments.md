iOS 10 adds *attachments* to notifications. An attachment is an image, video, or audio file which is downloaded to the device when a notification is received and shown alongside the notification. A thumbnail is shown when the notification is not expanded. The full size attachment is shown when the notification is expanded.

> To expand a notification on 3D Touch devices simply force touch any notification. On non-3D Touch devices swipe and tap the "View" button.

```yaml
- alias: Notify iOS app
    trigger:
      ...
    action:
      service: notify.ios_robbies_iphone_7_plus
      data:
        message: "Something happened at home!"
        data:
          attachment:
            url: "https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-assets/blob/master/logo-round-192x192.png?raw=true"
            content-type: png
            hide-thumbnail: false
```

Notes:

- The thumbnail of the notification will be the media at the `url`.
- The notification content is the media at the `url`.
- Attachment can be used with custom push notification categories.

## Example

An unexpanded push notification with an attachment.

## Configuration

- **url** (*Required*): The URL of content to use as the attachment. This URL *must* be accessible from the Internet, or the receiving device must be on the same network as the hosted content.
- **content-type** (*Optional*): By default, the extension of the URL will be checked to determine the filetype. If there is no extension/it can't be determined you can manually provide a file extension.
- **hide-thumbnail** (*Optional*): If set to `true` the thumbnail will not show on the notification. The content will only be viewable by expanding.
